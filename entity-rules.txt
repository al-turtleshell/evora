== DEV SPECIFICATION ==
- only write function

== TYPE ==
- every type should use io-ts library.
- optional type should be created with t.intersection, t.type and t.partial


=== ENTITY RULES ===
    == ATTRIBUTES == 
        - an entity must have at least two DTOs and self type:
            - CreateEntityDto 
            - EntityDto
            - Entity
        - DTo should be created with primitive type as t.string, t.number

        - entity data consists of attributes that will be presented as an array of JSON object :
            [
                {
                    name: "name of attribute",
                    primitive: "primitive type",
                    type: "current type",
                    condition: "condition to satisfy that type",
                    enum: "an array with enum values in case of enum type"
                    required: "boolean"
                }
            ]
